Emacs is the original and most supported editor for ENSIME.

If you are new to Emacs in general, we maintain some [Learning Emacs](/editors/emacs/learning)
resources to get you started.

If you are already competent with Emacs, head straight over to the [Installing](/editors/emacs/install) guide.

If you've already installed and configured Ensime for Emacs, browse the [user guide](http://ensime.github.io/editors/emacs/userguide/).
